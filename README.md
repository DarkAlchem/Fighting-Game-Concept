# Fighting-Game-Concept
 
A fun coding project that I did over the course of a couple of hours for a job interview. I loved doing this as it gave me a couple of game ideas and allowed me to lean into what i'm good at doing: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

# Features

This comes as a barebones project to be able to code hitboxes and hurtboxes in Javascript using animation frames as a game loop. This can easily be extended further to add sprites and graphics to the background. I might actually come back to this one day to extend some features.
