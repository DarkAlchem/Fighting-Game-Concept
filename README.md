# Fighting-Game-Concept
A fun coding project that I did over the course of a couple of hours for a job interview. I loved doing this as it gave me a couple of game ideas and allowed me to lean into what i'm good at doing: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

# Installation
This works as a simple webpage. Opening it in a modern browser will result in basic but fun couch co-op game for you.

# How to Play
it uses default W,A,S,D, and Arrow Keys to attack. 

# Features
This comes as a barebones project to be able to code hitboxes and hurtboxes in Javascript using animation frames as a game loop. This can easily be extended further to add sprites and graphics to the background. 

# Development
I might actually come back to this one day to extend some features.

# Licence
The code is under the MIT Licence.
